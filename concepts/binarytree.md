# Binary Tree

To understand Binary Tree, we need to understand what a tree is. Basically, we have a root and leaves. Since we are discussing Binary Tree, it means the leaves are just 2 or less(meaning 0).

```
         '
   '           '  
'     '     '      '
```

Our task will be to develop a python class for building Binary Tree in Python.

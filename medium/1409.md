#[1409. Queries on a Permutation With Key](https://leetcode.com/problems/queries-on-a-permutation-with-key/)



This problem seems complex when reading the description but if you follow the examples, it is pretty straightforward. The most important thing is to find pattern then use algorithm to write the pattern out.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def processQueries(self, queries: List[int], m: int) -> List[int]:
        p = list(range(1,m+1))
        result = []
        for i in  range(len(queries)):
            index = p.index(queries[i])
            result.append(index)
            p.insert(0,queries[i])
            del p[index+1]
        return result
```

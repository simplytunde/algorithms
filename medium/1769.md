#### First Take

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, boxes: str) -> List[int]:
        result = []
        for i in range(len(boxes)):
            result.append(0)
            for j,boxJ in enumerate(boxes):
                #There is something to move
                if i != j and boxJ != '0' :
                    result[-1] += abs(i-j)
        return results

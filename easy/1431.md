# [Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies](https://leetcode.com/problems/kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies/)

```python
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        greatest = max(candies)
        return [ candie + extraCandies >= greatest for candie in candies]
        
```



This particular question is very easy because you only have to check if the sum of each candie and extraCandies is greater than or equal to the greatest candie in the list.
